- # Welcome to my math graph
- ## What this knowledge graph is (not)
	- within this graph i currently maintain two of my projects fully dedicated to mathematical topics
		- my personal undergraduate program
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- MONA - Mathematik online Nachhilfe
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- i do freelance math teaching for highschool students and need to develop
				- concepts on how to breake down topics in order to be understood quickly but still as an abstract idea to apply in different situations
				- grundlage f√ºr unterrichts und kursmaterial (expecially for the wiki monas-library.rafaelwillsch.com)
	- this is not a wiki but a stripped down version of a personal dynamic pool of interrelated notes to my work with mathematical questions
	- this graph has **no teaching purposes** at all and doesnt claim to be correct. Feel free to contact me if you find major and minor issues within the graph and my assuptions.
	- ### this might be for you if
		- you are a student yourself and look for a different point of view and associations on the fundamental math concepts
		- you are interested in how some fundamental math concepts correlate with each other
	- ### this might not be for you if
		- you are looking for a wiki
		- you are looking for tutorials and structured explanations
		-
- ## How to guide (How the graph might be useful for you)
	- ### graph view
		- check the graph view and explore some concepts and their connections
	- ### random link paths
		- check a random site and follow the links
	- ### text search
		- search for whatever you are looking for, maybe you find something
	- ### exercises and questions
		- the graph exists because i need to learn math myself, hence you will find different exercises and questions
		- i have to learn myself that mathematical understandic wont come just by thinking and reading... i hope it does by doing the math.
- ## Annotations
	- The whole knowledge graph is written in german, because I have to work on the related topics in my mother tongue. An english version is currently not planned.
	- There is no guarantee that any thought is mahtematical correct, in contrary many thought will just be wrong, but thats part of learning
